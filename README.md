## 🪄 Who am I?

I am a **Prompt-Only Developer**.

- I don’t write Python, I say:  
  _“Sort this list in descending order.”_

- I don’t use C#, I say:  
  _“Build a UI with a glowing button that reacts to mouse hover.”_

- I don’t write SQL, I ask:  
  _“Can you find the top 5 entries by revenue in this CSV?”_

I code **with intention, context, and a bit of charm**.
